# SimpleQueueTool

This is a tool I made to help better manage tasks of varying priorities from different created categories. Colors are assigned to each category for easy viewing. SQT uses SQLite to persistently store what are essentially priority queues which can store items with pertinent info such as task name, priority, description, and estmiated completion time (minutes). I designed this tool to be used in a terminal since that is where most of my time is spent, and I wanted a task management tool which did not require a mouse.

Dependencies:
- python3
- prettytable python module
